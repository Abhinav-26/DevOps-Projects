<a href="https://github.com/Abhinav-26/DevOps-Integration/tree/master/DevOps%20Project-1">Project-1 : Automated WebDevelopment Environment</a><br>
In this Project I have created an Automated Web Development Environment integrating Git/GitHub, Jenkins and Httpd WebServer in RHEL-8. In this Project the developer just need to Commit the code from his local repository, GitHub will automatically send the code to Jenkins using webhooks as soon as there will be any commit in GitHub repo, and Jenkins will then automatically launch the website into apache2 httpd server which is setup in RHEL-8.<br>

In this Project I have used the concepts of docker to make Automation Project lanching docker-within-docker so that the Project can be easily shipped from one system to another without any problem. Docker Concepts are very useful for such projects when you need to send your project with complete environment of the project.<br>
